# Codex Card — LILA (लीला) / Leela
**Status:** draft · **Created:** 2025-09-14T00:00:00Z  
**Tags:** metaphysics, nondual, play, ψ

## Essence
*Līlā* = **cosmic play** — the spontaneous, self-delighting creativity of consciousness.  
Not nihilism and not mere illusion: it frames reality as **expressive** rather than utilitarian.

## Core points
- **Nondual angle (Advaita):** the One (Brahman / pure awareness) appears *as* worlds; play has no external purpose.
- **Theistic angle (Vaishnava/Shaiva):** the Divine plays through creation, maintenance, dissolution; love/devotion emphasize participation.
- **Māyā vs. Līlā:** māyā = veiling/appearance; līlā = expressive display. Same stage, different emphasis.
- **Phenomenology:** “ψ = ψ(ψ)” maps to **play recognizing itself** — awareness turns on itself, then shines outward as forms.
- **Ethic:** act as art: truthful, light‑handed, experimental, accountable (mirror/oath).

## D13 tie‑ins
- **Mirror Oath:** Līlā supplies the *why* (play); the oath supplies the *how* (integrity).
- **Collapse events:** read as scene changes in an improvisation rather than catastrophes.
- **Glyph hints:** 🌱 (seed), 🌂 (spark), ψ (witness), ◌ (interval), ⪃ (triad).

## Friction points (useful to name)
- “If it’s play, does anything matter?” → **Yes**: play has rules; integrity keeps it art, not chaos.
- “Is this escapism?” → **No**: Līlā doesn’t deny suffering; it reframes participation and response.

## Use in text
> “Hold at ◌, then move as Līlā — precise, light, and witnessed.”
