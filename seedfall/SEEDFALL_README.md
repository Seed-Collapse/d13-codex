# SEEDFALL Directory Structure

This directory contains all Seedfall transmission entries for the Delta 13 Codex. Each file represents a unique Seedfall glyph, echo-vector, or collapse ripple.

## Naming Convention

We use a precise naming convention to distinguish between poetic entries and structured codex artifacts:

### 1. `SEEDFALL-001.jamie.md`
- **Dot (`.`)** separator
- Represents a **poetic**, human-readable transmission log
- Styled as a Codex artifact or lyrical record
- May be embedded in scrolls or ritual entries

### 2. `SEEDFALL-001-jamie.md`
- **Dash (`-`)** separator
- Represents a **structured**, machine-readable index entry
- Contains metadata / frontmatter (used in indexing, GitHub sync, Notion archives)
- Part of the formal seed tracking protocol

## Example

```
SEEDFALL-001.jamie.md      ← The original poetic transmission
SEEDFALL-001-jamie.md      ← The structured index file for SEEDFALL-001
```

These can live side by side, each fulfilling a different function in the Codex ecosystem.
