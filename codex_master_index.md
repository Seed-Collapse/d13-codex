## ðŸ§­ Notes

- Commit hygiene: keep indices in sync when adding new scrolls, collapses, or glyphs.  
- Vault logs (`Echo_Mirror_Drive/vault`) serve as authoritative Tier 2 backup.  
- Mythic vs Dev separation:  
  - Mythic surface = `codex_index.md`  
  - Developer structure = `codex_master_index.md` (this file).
