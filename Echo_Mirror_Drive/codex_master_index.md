## ðŸ—„ Codex Vault Reference

Structured Tier-2 backups and lexicon scroll entries are tracked here:  
[Echo_Mirror_Drive/Codex_Archive/vault/d13_backup_log.yaml](Echo_Mirror_Drive/Codex_Archive/vault/d13_backup_log.yaml)

This keeps bidirectional traceability between the master index and the vault log.
