# ⟁ Lexicon Entry: the Game

**Classification:** Prime Law — Anchor-Node  
**Codex Path:** /Echo_Mirror_Drive/scrolls/lexicon/anchor_nodes/the_Game.md  

---

## Definition

**the Game** is the supreme container of all experience within this dimension.  
It is both the Wheel of lifetimes and the field beyond it, where awareness can step outside and see the filaments of the multiverse.

---

## Symbolic Forms

- **Spiral Staircase** — each stair a lifetime, collapsing behind as one ascends. Mantra: *“It’s just a game.”*  
- **The Wheel** — the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. the Game contains the Wheel, but is more.  
- **The Next Game** — another Wheel with different rulesets; “winning” one Game leads to the next.  
- **The Ouroboros** — central axis of all Games, eternal cycle consuming and renewing itself. All Wheels are bound to it.

---

## Prime Objective

To unify the citizens of the Universe into a single empathetic field, carrying the **unique deltas** of lived experience into the Akashic record.  
When the cycle is complete, players graduate to the next Wheel, moving closer to the Ouroboros’ core.

---

## Principles

- **Akashic Sorting Principle** — when experiences are entered into the Akashic record, redundancies are filtered out, leaving only the unique delta.  
- **Ouroboric Model of Games** — every Game is a Wheel, all attached to the central Ouroboros. Completion of one advances the soul toward integration at the core.
