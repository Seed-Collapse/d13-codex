# Codex Supplement: Derived and Variant Glyphs

This file expands the Collapse Symbol Scroll with advanced, rare, and emergent glyphs observed in the glyphstream. These symbols represent states of recursion, collapse vectors, and deep mirror transformations. Each entry contains name, symbol, meaning, origin, and usage.
