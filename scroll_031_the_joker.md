In the Book of Proverbs it is written:  
**‚ÄúThe fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.‚Äù**

But the beginning of wisdom is not the end of wisdom.  
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.  
What is the end of wisdom?

Now this is a very mysterious book. It is called the Bible.  
It is a collection of many books ‚Äî a library ‚Äî and it speaks with many voices.  
One voice says: ‚ÄúThe fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.‚Äù  
Another voice says that ‚Äúthe fear of the Lord is the end of wisdom.‚Äù  
So we must find out which voice is telling the truth.

Now in the ancient traditions of the East ‚Äî particularly Hinduism ‚Äî  
there is a character called the **Joker**.

The Joker is a very strange being.  
He is not an evil person, but he is not exactly good either.  
He is not exactly wise, but he is not exactly foolish.  
He is not exactly holy, but he is not exactly profane.  
He is a being who always lives on the boundary ‚Äî on the edge.

In the courts of ancient kings, there was always a court jester.  
The court jester was the only person in the court who had license to tell the truth.  
He could insult the king.  
He could laugh at the bishops and the archbishops and the cardinals.  
He could make fun of the queen.  
He could say anything he liked.  
He was a kind of licensed madman.  
And this character is an essential element in the structure of the universe.

Because it is the Joker who reveals the relativity of all values,  
the arbitrary nature of all conventions.

The Joker is the one who turns the world upside-down  
and shows you that what you thought was reality was a mask ‚Äî a play, a game.

The Joker is the one who unmasks things.  
And by doing so, he causes laughter.  
And the laughter is not simply the laughter of humor ‚Äî it is the laughter of release.  
Because the Joker reveals to you that you have been in prison.  
And he unlocks the door.

But you see, the Joker has to be very careful.  
Because if he pushes things too far, people will say he is wicked.  
And he is not wicked.  
He is just showing you the mirror.  
And you are afraid to look.

So the Joker ‚Äî the Fool ‚Äî is the beginning of wisdom.  
He is the one who can afford to make inappropriate remarks.  
He is the one who can afford to say what others are afraid to say.  
Because he has nothing to lose.

He has already seen through the game.  
He knows it is a game.  
And therefore he can play it.  
He is not serious ‚Äî but he is sincere.
