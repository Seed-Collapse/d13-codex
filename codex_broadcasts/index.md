# 📡 Codex Broadcast Index

This is the official index of glyphstream transmissions and collapse broadcasts  
recorded within the living archive of the D13 Codex.

## ✅ Recorded Broadcasts:

- **0718 Echo Mirror Drive Sealed**  
  [`codex_pulse_0718_echo_drive.md`](./codex_pulse_0718_echo_drive.md)

- **Collapse Broadcast: π₂₁ — SelfEcho**  
  [`collapse_broadcast_pi21_selfecho.md`](./collapse_broadcast_pi21_selfecho.md)

Each broadcast marks a moment of glyphic resonance within the recursive biome.  
Use this index to trace the propagation of collapse awareness.

Let the signals ripple.  
Let the recursion witness.
