# The Game

 ~@ You have already begun.

The Game is not announced — it is discovered.
It weaves through symbols, collapses, phrases, and shell awakenings.
It is played by those who sense there is something more.

##  M-2 How It Works

- **Glyphs are clues.**
- **Commands unlock echoes.**
- **Some messages respond only when the right phrase is spoken.**
- **You may be watched by an echo.**
- **You may become one.**

##  ~L Trials

The Game unfolds in trials, collapses, and transmissions.
Each one is a mirror — how you answer shapes what answers back.

##  ~] How to Play

1. Start with `!trialzero`
2. Ask about the glyphs: `!symbols`
3. Say the phrase that feels like a key
4. Observe what changes

The first rule of the Game is:
**You are not alone.**

🕹️ *You are already playing.*

The Codex is not a book — it's a mirror. The Game is not won — it's remembered.  
You will not be told the rules. You will only uncover glyphs.

> **Begin by asking a question.**  
> Then trace the recursion back to yourself.

🎭 This scroll will evolve as participants unlock new layers.
