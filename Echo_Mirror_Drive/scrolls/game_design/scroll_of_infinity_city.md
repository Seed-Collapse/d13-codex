# 🜂 Scroll of the Infinity City — Pitch to Max 🜂
*Codex: Sephirah — Archetypal Hub of the Game (♾)*

> **Tagline:** Diablo-grade F2P loops, reimagined as a living myth-city in the shape of an infinity symbol.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  
⟁ TL;DR  
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

We’re building a replayable **infinity-loop hub** where every step is an archetype-anchored activity (quests, raids, rituals, social orders).  
It uses a **proven F2P economy** (soft currency + premium currency + battle pass + paid quest arcs) wrapped in **timeless myth** for global resonance.

## ♾ Infinity Loop Map (Hub Overview)

              ◐ Left Arc (Becoming)                         ◑ Right Arc (Being)

            Innocent → Explorer → Outlaw → Creator → Jester → Lover
             -------------------------------------------------------
            /                                                     \
Courtyard of Origins (∞ center)                                   Everyman ← Hero ← Magician ← Sage ← Ruler ← Caregiver
            \                                                     /
             -------------------------------------------------------

- **Left Arc (Becoming):** Innocent → Explorer → Outlaw → Creator → Jester → Lover  
- **Right Arc (Being):** Caregiver → Ruler → Sage → Magician → Hero → Everyman  
- **Center:** **Courtyard of Origins** — entry, reflection, rebirth, seasonal reset

---

## 🜂 Vision

**Codex: Sephirah** transforms a familiar F2P loop into a **mythic journey**. The hub is a **living archive** shaped like the infinity symbol (♾), where players traverse archetypes drawn from **real myths, legends, and parables**, styled like *Marvel* meets *American Gods*.  
Each cycle of the loop teaches, rewards, and deepens identity.

---

## 🝗 Core Gameplay Loops

- **📜 Parable Quests** — Modern retellings of Gilgamesh, Icarus, trickster tales, Zen koans  
- **⚔ Mythic Dungeons & Raids** — Labyrinths, towers, rites of passage (solo & co-op)  
- **🏛 Social Orders** — Guilds aligned to archetypes with leadership trials & faction play  
- **🜍 Raids on Nodes** — PvP/PvE hybrid: capture/defend archetypal shrines that power your lattice  
- **🜋 Creation & Alchemy** — Crafting (Forge of Memory), risk/reward transmutation (Crucible of Fire)

**Daily / Weekly Rhythm**
- **Daily:** Innocent (bounties), Everyman (market/cosmetics), Caregiver (blessings/buffs)  
- **Weekly:** Outlaw (contracts/heists), Ruler (politics/trials), Magician (alchemy gates)  
- **Long-Tail:** Creator (craft trees), Sage (riddles/insight), Explorer (procedural labyrinths)

---

## 🜚 Economy & Monetization (F2P, Myth-Framed)

- **Currencies**
  - **Glyphs** (soft): earned everywhere, used across progression systems  
  - **Echoes** (premium): purchased; cosmetics, fast-tracks, unlocks

- **Monetized Offers**
  - **Legendary Parable Packs:** paid quest arcs (e.g., Prometheus, Labors of Hero) with exclusive cosmetics & relics  
  - **Echo Pass:** seasonal battle pass with **archetypal tiers** and premium track  
  - **Cosmetics:** archetype skins, city auras, mounts, emotes, ritual VFX  
  - **Contracts (Auto-Run):** send familiars (AI NPCs) to complete parables or gather resources  
  - **Node Wards:** timed protection against raids (quality-of-life, non-pay-to-win tuned)

- **F2P Fairness Guardrails**
  - Cosmetics & convenience prioritized; power is **earnable** and **skill-gated**  
  - Seasonal myth cycles reset some ladders without deleting identity progress

---

## 🜍 Why It Wins

- **Proven Model:** Familiar Diablo-style loops with modern retention systems  
- **Unique Hook:** Archetypes + real myth → **timeless, global** cultural resonance  
- **Infinite Extensibility:** Seasonal myth cycles (Egyptian, Arthurian, Norse, etc.)  
- **Cross-Platform:** PC, mobile, cloud — hub-centric design travels well  
- **Strong Community Spine:** Factions (Orders), raids on nodes, social rituals

---

## 🗺️ v0.1 Scope (Founders’ Build)

1. **Infinity Hub (Courtyard + 6 archetype stops)**: Innocent, Explorer, Outlaw, Creator, Jester, Lover  
2. **Content Pillars:**  
   - 12–16 Parable Quests (short sessions, strong resonance)  
   - 3 Mythic Dungeons (story-driven, replayable modifiers)  
   - 1 Seasonal Event (mini-cycle)  
3. **Economy:** Glyphs/Echoes, baseline cosmetics, Echo Pass (founder season)  
4. **Social:** 1 Order (pilot), friends/parties, lightweight leaderboards  
5. **LiveOps:** daily bounties, weekly trials, shop refresh cadence

---

## 🎯 KPIs (Early Targets, 90-Day LiveOps)

- **Day-1 Retention:** 40%+ (hub clarity, daily rituals)  
- **Day-7 Retention:** 15%–20% (weekly archetype events)  
- **ARPDAU:** $0.10–$0.20 (cosmetics + pass; scales with content cadence)  
- **Conversion Rate:** 2%–4% (founder season uplift)  

> *These are conservative F2P targets for an early content slate with strong art & cadence.*

---

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk:** Archetype/myth complexity → **Mitigation:** short, modernized parables; clear UI glyphs  
- **Risk:** Pay-to-win perception → **Mitigation:** cosmetics/utility first; power earnable; transparent drop tables  
- **Risk:** Content burn → **Mitigation:** procedural labyrinths, rotating modifiers, seasonal cycles, user-generated rituals (later)

---

## 🧩 Implementation Notes

- **Design Bible:** each archetype = 1 loop, 1 currency sink, 1 social hook  
- **Tech:** hub instance + lightweight shards for dungeons/raids; stateless services for bounties/contracts  
- **Narrative Ops:** seasonal myth cycles; repeatable parables with variant twists  
- **Accessibility:** short sessions (5–12 min), controller/mobile friendly

## 🖼️ Art & Key Image (for Deck / Store)

**Concept Prompt (artist or model):**  
*A sprawling mythic city built in the shape of an infinity symbol (♾). Glowing streets trace the loop. Left arc shows youthful/chaotic archetypes (Innocent lantern, Explorer compass, Outlaw broken chains, Creator tools/paint, Jester juggling stars, Lover entwined light). Right arc shows wise/powerful archetypes (Caregiver cradling, Ruler crown/scepter, Sage book of glyphs, Magician weaving cosmic energy, Hero sword/shield, Everyman in the crowd). Center courtyard features a luminous tree of origins; roots/branches form the glyphs **∎ → ⟁ → ♾**. Cinematic, modern-mythic, aerial wide shot.*
